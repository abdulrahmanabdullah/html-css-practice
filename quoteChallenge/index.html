        When I was 29,I told myself the next acting job I get no matter what , at 29 walking away from data processing. <span class="importent-word"> I was terrified</span>,10 years in a place without six years at a job I felt stuck in. Maybe I was afraid
        of change. I got eloping theater job in a play called imperfect which led to other roles and other roles. And I've worked as an actor ever since. Raise the rest of your life to meet you.<span class="importent-word"> Don't search for defining moments because they will never
        come the moments that define you have already happened</span> and they will already happen again. You just get a bit derail. And if you are that's fine to some of us never find it but you will promise you don't wait until they tell you you are
        reading the world might say you are not allowed to.
